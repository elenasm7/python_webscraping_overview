    "# Web Scraping in Python for Beginners \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I will give an introduction to webscraping in python. This will not be an exhaustive overview of all the resources at your disposal with python, but it should be enough to help you in the beginning. The two tools I will be going over in this post are Beautiful Soup (utilizing Requests) and Selenium. The only other major option you have available is Scrapy. First, we will go over Beautiful Soup, then Selenium, and in the end, we will bring them together! Along the way, I will discuss the pros and cons of both.\n",

    "Beautiful Soup is a python package that parces XML and HTML. It makes it very easy to get data from the html data avaible on the website. However, it does have it's pitfalls. These include not being able to grab data as easily from dynamic pages. In those situations we will use Selenium.\n",
