    "In this notebook, I will give an introduction to webscraping in python. This will not be an exhaustive overview of all the resources at your disposal with python, but it should be enough to help you in the beginning. The library I will be going over in this post is Beautiful Soup (utilizing Requests). In my next tutorial, I will go over how to utalize Beautiful Soup and Selenium together. The only other major option you have available is Scrapy. Along the way, I will discuss your options and leave more tutorials for different aspects of this project that are outside of the scope of Beautiful Soup.\n",
